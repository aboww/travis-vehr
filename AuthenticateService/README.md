Ethercis Authenticate Service
=============================

This module implements the logic associated to users credentials.

Although intended to be used as a service, it is instantiated whenever a new session is created for a user then bound to the session to perform further credentials checks including permissions.

At the moment, Authenticate uses [SHIRO](http://shiro.apache.org/) as security framework, but can be adapted to any
other strategy.
